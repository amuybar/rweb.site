## How to get one?
1. 🌟 Star this repo.
2. 🍴 Fork this repo.
3. 🧠 Think of a unique subdomain for your site. It should be no less than 2 words. 
4. 🔍 Open [`records.json`](/records.json), and use `Ctrl`+`F5` to check whether it was claimed. If it was, think of another domain.
5. ⚙️ Set the custom subdomain for your site.
6. 📄 Add the subdomain to `cname` in [`records.json`](/records.json) file, for example, `"xxx": "your-site.vercel.app"`.
7. 🥰 Make a Pull Request to this repo.

If everything is fine, your Pull Request will be merged within 3 days, and you can enjoy your subdomain after 1~10 minutes (for the DNS record to update) after that.  

✅ Your subdomain is guaranteed. We have acquired `rweb.site` for **10 years**, and we plan to renew it at the 9th year.  

## Why?
There was a time when I couldn't afford a domain or didn't want to spend money on a domain for a project that I wasn't sure would be successful. I used to use free subdomains from services like `github.io` or something else provided by the kind community, and I'm grateful for that. But I think it's time to give back. 🎁  

Sometimes, you just want a short and easy-to-remember domain for your project or website. `rweb.site` is a free service that provides you with a subdomain for your project or website. It's easy to remember and looks cool. 🔮  

## FAQ
**Q:** What does `rwebsite` mean?  
**A:** It stands for "revolutionary website" or "real website". You can also think of it as whatever you like.  

**Q:** How to change or remove my subdomain?  
**A:** Just modify [`records.json`](/records.json), and make a Pull Request to this repo.  

**Q:** May I apply for more than one subdomain?  
**A:** Yes, you can. However, starting from your second subdomain, you can only apply subdomains for your projects which have no less than 5 stars. If you are using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), we strongly recommend you to bind the subdomain to your `your-username.github.io` domain, so that you can use path-based routing for whatever you like.  

**Q:** Are other DNS records supported?  
**A:** Currently, due to legal issues, we only support `CNAME` records.  

**Q:** Can I use it for my commercial projects?  
**A:** Yes, you can.
